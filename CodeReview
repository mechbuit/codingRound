Code review comments:

1. Code does not use java oops concepts.
2. Using hard wait Thread.sleep, is not recommended. Selenium provides with dynamic wait and it should be used. 
7. Design pattern can be used such as Page Factory.
4. Property file can be used to supply once used values which may subject to change due to change in environment i.e. Staging, QA, Dev. like URL.
5. No utility class.
6. No Selenium helper class where reusable methods can be added. like click, sendKeys, wait and many more should be in selenium helper class. 
7. POM (Page Object Model) can be used for better readability and further maintenance.
